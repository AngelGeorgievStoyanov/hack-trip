# HackTrip Backend API Contract

This document is the authoritative, finalized production API contract of the HackTrip backend, derived from the current implemented source code (`feature/backend-modernization`). It describes what the backend currently does; it does not describe future plans, migration work, or recommendations.

Repository source code is authoritative. This document documents implemented behavior only.

The documented production request path is:

```text
Frontend -> Nginx -> Express -> middleware -> Controller -> Service -> Repository -> Prisma -> MySQL
```

All API endpoints live under the versioned prefix:

```text
/api/v1
```

---

## 1. Global API Rules

### 1.1 Client marker header

Every Frontend API request to `/api/v1` must carry the client marker header. This applies to every endpoint, including every authentication endpoint (`register`, `login`, `verify-email`, `resend-verification`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password`, `refresh`, `logout`, `me`, and all profile endpoints). It is required independently of `Authorization`:

```http
x-hacktrip-client: web
```

This is a public, copyable request-shape filter — NOT authentication and NOT authorization.

- A request without this header to a `/api/v1` or `/api/v1/...` path is answered with `404` and the standard API error body `{ "error": { "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Resource not found." } }`.
- A request without this header to a non-`/api/v1` path is answered with an empty `404` body (`.end()`).
- `OPTIONS` (CORS preflight) cannot carry custom headers, so it bypasses this filter and is handled by CORS.

### 1.2 Public frontend bearer token

The anonymous/public Frontend context uses:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <PUBLIC_FRONTEND_TOKEN>
```

- Default value: `hacktrip-public-v1` (overridable via `PUBLIC_FRONTEND_TOKEN`).
- The token is public, non-secret, copyable, and is not a JWT, a user credential, a session, or an ownership identity.
- It is compared by raw string equality only and is never passed to JWT verification.
- It grants anonymous, read-only access only; it grants no user, session, or ownership identity and no write capability.

### 1.3 CORS

- Production origins: `https://hack-trip.com`, `https://www.hack-trip.com`.
- Development origin: `http://localhost:3000` (only outside production).
- Methods: `GET,POST,PUT,DELETE`.
- Allowed headers: `x-hacktrip-client`, `Content-Type`, `Authorization`.
- `credentials: true` (the refresh-token cookie is HttpOnly and requires credentialed cross-origin requests).

### 1.4 Security headers

- `X-Powered-By` is disabled.
- HSTS: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`.
- Proxy trust: 1 hop (`trust proxy = 1`).

### 1.5 Request body limits

- JSON: `1mb`.
- URL-encoded: `100kb` with `parameterLimit: 1000`.
- Multipart (images only): handled by a route-specific Multer configuration; one binary part, `25 MB` per file (see Images).

### 1.6 Rate limits

Public API rate limit (applied to everything under `/api`):

- Fixed window `60s`, `120` requests per client IP.
- Exceeding it produces `403` with error code `FORBIDDEN` (the contract has no `429`).

Authentication rate limit (applied only to auth endpoints):

- Default window `15 * 60s` (900s), default `10` attempts per window for credential/token endpoints (`register`, `verify-email`, `login`, `refresh`, `confirm-password`, `change-password`, `reset-password`).
- Default `5` attempts per window for email-sending endpoints (`resend-verification`, `forgot-password`).
- Exceeding it produces `403` with error code `FORBIDDEN`.
- Keyed by client IP + route bucket. Values are configurable via `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`, `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`, `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_EMAIL_MAX`.

Administrative rate limit (applied to every admin endpoint):

- `120` requests per window per client IP (window = auth rate-limit window, default 900s).
- Exceeding it produces `403 FORBIDDEN`.

### 1.7 Validation model

- Request validation uses Zod with `.strict()` on every body/params/query schema: undeclared body fields, query parameters, and route parameters are rejected with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- Endpoints that declare no body/query/params must receive an empty corresponding part; a non-empty undeclared part is rejected with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- A rejected request is `400` with code `VALIDATION_ERROR` and a message naming the offending field. At most 3 issues are reported per validation failure.

### 1.8 Strictness summary

- All request bodies are `.strict()`: unknown JSON keys are rejected.
- All query schemas are `.strict()`: unknown query parameters are rejected.
- All route-parameter schemas are `.strict()`.

## 2. Authentication Contract

### 2.1 Access token

- Type: JWT (HS256).
- Secret: `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` (required; the API refuses to start without it).
- Payload claims: `{ sub: <userId>, type: 'access' }`.
- `sub` is the user id (UUID string). Role and status are NOT taken from token claims; they are always read from the database row.
- Expiry: `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` seconds; default `900` (15 minutes).

### 2.2 Refresh token

- Type: opaque random token, 32 bytes hex-encoded = 64 characters.
- Only its SHA-256 hash is stored in the database (`refresh_tokens.tokenHash`).
- Delivered via an HttpOnly cookie and never in a response body.

Refresh cookie:

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| name | `hack_trip_refresh` |
| HttpOnly | `true` |
| Secure | `true` in production (or when `COOKIE_SECURE=true`) |
| SameSite | `none` in production (default), `lax` in development; overridable via `COOKIE_SAME_SITE` |
| Path | `/api/v1/auth` |
| Expiration | `refreshTokenExpiresAt` (now + `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` seconds) |
| maxAge | `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN * 1000` ms |

`REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN` default: `2592000` seconds (30 days).

Rotation behavior:

- Every successful `login` and `refresh` issues a NEW refresh token (the old one is revoked on refresh).
- A `refresh` that finds a token whose `revokedAt` is already set treats it as REUSE: all active refresh sessions of that account are revoked, and the request is answered with `401 UNAUTHORIZED` (message "The refresh session was already revoked. All sessions of this account were revoked.").
- An expired refresh token is `401 UNAUTHORIZED` ("The refresh session has expired.").
- A missing/unknown refresh token is `401 UNAUTHORIZED` ("The refresh session is not valid.").

### 2.3 Account status rules (enforced on every authenticated request and every login/refresh)

- `PENDING_VERIFICATION` or `emailVerifiedAt === null`: `403 EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`.
- `SUSPENDED`: `403 ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED`.
- `DEACTIVATED`: `403 ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED`.
- Missing user (valid token but account deleted): `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.

### 2.4 Email / password-reset tokens

- Email verification token TTL: `86400` seconds (24h).
- Password reset token TTL: `3600` seconds (1h).
- Tokens are one-time; only the SHA-256 hash is stored.

### 2.5 Auth email links

The emailed verification and password-reset links are constructed as `<appUrl><path>?token=<rawToken>` (the raw token is URL-encoded).

- `appUrl` = `AUTH_APP_URL` (default `https://www.hack-trip.com`; trailing slash trimmed).
- Verification path = `AUTH_VERIFY_EMAIL_PATH` (default `/verify-email`).
- Password-reset path = `AUTH_PASSWORD_RESET_PATH` (default `/reset-password`).
- A leading `/` is added to the path when it is not already present.

The raw token only appears inside the email sent to the account owner; it is never logged or returned in an API response.

---

## 3. Headers

### 3.1 Required request headers

| Header | Required | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `x-hacktrip-client` | Always (except `OPTIONS`) | `web` | Frontend client marker |
| `Authorization` | At every authentication boundary (including public reads) | `Bearer <token>` | Bearer classification |

### 3.2 Authentication outcomes (shared v1 boundary)

| Request state | Result |
| --- | --- |
| No `Authorization` header | `404 NOT_FOUND` (never anonymous) |
| `Authorization: Bearer <PUBLIC_FRONTEND_TOKEN>` | Anonymous context on optional-auth routes; `401 UNAUTHORIZED` on protected routes |
| `Authorization: Bearer <USER_ACCESS_TOKEN>` (valid) | Authenticated user context |
| Invalid/expired user access JWT | `401 UNAUTHORIZED` (never anonymous) |
| Valid JWT + suspended/deactivated/unverified account | `403` with the relevant account-status code |

The public token is never passed to JWT verification. An invalid user JWT is never downgraded to anonymous.

---

## 4. Error Contract

Every error (including route-not-found and rate-limit) uses the same JSON shape:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "<CODE>", "message": "<message>" } }
```

### 4.1 Error codes and HTTP status

| Code | HTTP | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Validation failures (incl. bad tokens, oversized/parse-failed bodies) |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 | Missing/invalid token, invalid credentials, account gone, refresh failures |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Role/ownership/authorization denial; rate limiting (no 429 in contract) |
| `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` | 403 | Correct password but email unverified |
| `ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` | 403 | Suspended account |
| `ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED` | 403 | Deactivated account |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Generic not found; also missing client header and missing Authorization on auth boundaries |
| `TRIP_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Trip (group) not found / ownerless trip during modification |
| `CONFLICT` | 409 | Duplicate/conflict (image limit, last-day delete, duplicate report, user still owns content, duplicate day number) |
| `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected errors (details logged server-side only) |

### 4.2 Status codes used

`200`, `201`, `204`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `500`.

There is no `429`: rate limiting is reported as `403 FORBIDDEN`.

### 4.3 Body-parser failures

- `entity.too.large` -> `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` "The request body is too large."
- `entity.parse.failed` -> `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` "The request body is not valid JSON."
- `encoding.unsupported` -> `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` "The request body encoding is not supported."

---

## 5. Access Control Matrix

Roles: `user`, `admin`, `manager`.

- `MODERATOR_ROLES` = `admin`, `manager` (may modify any trip/day/point/image and perform admin reads + moderation).
- `ADMIN_ROLES` = `admin` (full account administration: user updates).
- `ADMIN_OR_MODERATOR_ROLES` = `admin`, `manager`.

Authorization model:

- `requireAuthentication`: bearer required; public token -> `401`; invalid token -> `401`; account status enforced; role is NOT checked.
- `optionalAuthentication`: bearer required; public token -> anonymous; valid token -> authenticated viewer; invalid token -> `401`; no bearer -> `404`.
- `requireRole([...roles])`: `requireAuthentication` + the database row's role must be in the given list, else `403 FORBIDDEN`.
- Ownership (`canModifyTrip`): the actor may modify a trip/day/point/image only when `ownerId === actor.id` OR the actor's role is `admin` or `manager`.

### 5.1 Matrix

## 6. Auth Endpoints

All auth routes are mounted at `/api/v1/auth`.

> `Auth: none` in this section means no `Authorization` token is required. The `x-hacktrip-client: web` header is STILL required for every auth endpoint, exactly as for every other `/api/v1` endpoint (see §1.1).

### 6.1 POST `/auth/register`

- Auth: none. Rate-limited (`register` bucket).
- Body (strict): `{ email, password, firstName, lastName }`.
- Response `201`: `{ "message": "..." }` (`MessageResponse`).
- Anti-enumeration: an already-registered email and a successful registration return the same message ("If the address can be registered, verification instructions will be sent.").

### 6.2 POST `/auth/verify-email`

- Auth: none. Rate-limited (`verify-email` bucket).
- Body (strict): `{ token }`.
- Response `200`: `{ "user": AuthUserDto }`.
- Errors: unknown/used/expired token -> `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`.

### 6.3 POST `/auth/resend-verification`

- Auth: none. Rate-limited (email, `resend-verification` bucket).
- Body (strict): `{ email }`.
- Response `200`: `{ "message": "..." }`.

`AuthSessionDto`:

```json
{ "accessToken": "<jwt>", "tokenType": "Bearer", "expiresIn": 900, "user": AuthUserDto }
```

### 6.5 POST `/auth/refresh`

- Auth: none (reads the refresh cookie). Rate-limited (`refresh` bucket). No body/query/params.
- Response `200`: `AuthSessionDto` and rotates (sets a new) refresh cookie.
- Errors: missing/unknown -> `401 UNAUTHORIZED`; expired -> `401 UNAUTHORIZED`; reuse -> `401 UNAUTHORIZED` (all sessions revoked); unusable account -> `403` account-status code. On refusal, the stale cookie is cleared.

### 6.6 POST `/auth/logout`

- Auth: none (reads the refresh cookie). No body/query/params.
- Response `200`: `{ "message": "Logged out." }` and clears the refresh cookie. Idempotent.

- Errors: wrong current password -> `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.

### 6.11 GET `/auth/me/image`

- Auth: `requireAuthentication`. No body/query/params.
- Response `200`: `ImageDto` or `null` (no profile image).

### 6.12 POST `/auth/me/image`

- Auth: `requireAuthentication`. Multipart upload (field `file`, exactly one file).
- Response `201`: `ImageDto`. Replaces any previous profile image (the previous file is removed).

}
```

## 7. Config Endpoints

Mounted at `/api/v1/config`. Auth: `optionalAuthentication` (public token = anonymous; a valid user token is accepted but not required).

### 7.1 GET `/config/selects`

- Query/body/params: none.
- Response `200`: `SelectConfig[]`.

`SelectConfig`:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "key": "<string>",
  "name": "<string>",
  "isActive": true,
  "options": [
    { "id": 0, "selectTypeId": 0, "key": "<string>", "value": "<string>", "sortOrder": 0, "isActive": true }
  ]
}
```

### 7.2 GET `/config/services`

- Query/body/params: none.
- Response `200`: `PublicServiceConfig[]` (public-safe subset only).

`PublicServiceConfig`:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "key": "google_maps" | "mui" | "ui" | "visual" | "routing",
  "name": "<string>",
  "isActive": true,
  "configs": [
    { "id": 0, "serviceTypeId": 0, "key": "<string>", "value": "<string>", "type": "string"|"number"|"boolean"|"json", "isActive": true }
  ]
}
```

### Public service-config key whitelist

`GET /config/services` returns only the following per-service keys (from `src/mappers/publicConfigMapper.ts`). All other service-config rows are filtered out of the public response:

```text
google_maps:  map_width, map_height, zoom_control, gesture_handling,
              point_map_height, point_map_type_control
mui:          theme_direction
ui:           page_size_options, page_size_default
visual:       image_base_url, background_images_base_url, thumb_width,
              thumb_height, thumb_quality, thumb_fit, thumb_auto
routing:      home_path, login_path, not_found_path, verify_email_path
```

## 8. Trip Endpoints

Mounted at `/api/v1/trips`.

### Data model note (critical)

- A **Trip** = one `trip_groups` row. Its `id` is the trip id.
- A **Day** = one `trips` row of that group. A day has no separate entity; a day's only identifier is that row's `Trip.id`.
- A Day's `dayNumber` is an ordering value (1..n), NOT an identifier.
- A trip's metadata (`title`, `description`, `group`, `transport`) is stored on the canonical (lowest `dayNumber`) day row.
- `group`/`transport` are dynamic-config select keys resolved to `{ key, name }` in responses.
- Days are returned in `dayNumber` ascending order (tie-break `id` ascending).
- Points within a day are returned in numeric `pointNumber` order.

### 8.1 GET `/trips`

- Auth: `optionalAuthentication` (public token = anonymous; user token = viewer-specific social state).
- Query (strict): `page`, `limit`, `search`, `group`, `transport`, `sort`.
- Response `200`: `TripListResponse`.

`TripListResponse`:

```json
{
  "items": [ TripListItem ],
  "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 0, "totalPages": 0 }
}
```

`TripListItem`:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "title": "<string>",
  "description": null | "<string>",
  "group": { "key": "<string>", "name": "<string>" },
  "transport": { "key": "<string>", "name": "<string>" },
  "author": { "id": "<uuid>", "firstName": "<string>", "lastName": "<string>" },
  "coverImage": null | "<url>",
  "createdAt": null | "<iso>"
}
```

Query semantics:

- `page` default `1`, max `10000`.
- `limit` default `20`, max `100`.
- `sort` = `newest` (default) or `oldest` (order by trip-group `createdAt`, tie-break `id`).
- `search` = substring match (`contains`) on a day's `title` or `description`.
- `group` / `transport` = filter by select value; accepts either the select `key` or the display `value` (case-insensitive). Unknown value -> `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- Filters combine with AND on a single day row (a trip matches when at least one of its days satisfies all given filters).

### 8.2 GET `/trips/:id`

- Auth: `optionalAuthentication`.
- Path params (strict): `{ id: positiveInteger }`.
- Response `200`: `TripDetails`. Missing trip -> `404 TRIP_NOT_FOUND`.

`TripDetails`:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "title": "<string>",
  "description": null | "<string>",
  "group": { "id": 0, "key": "<string>", "name": "<string>" },
  "transport": { "key": "<string>", "name": "<string>" },
  "author": { "id": "<uuid>", "firstName": "<string>", "lastName": "<string>" },
  "coverImage": null | "<url>",
  "days": [ TripDay ],
  "social": SocialState,
  "createdAt": null | "<iso>",
  "updatedAt": null | "<iso>"
}
```

### 8.3 POST `/trips`

- Auth: `requireAuthentication`.
- Body (strict): `{ title, description, group, transport }`.
- Response `201`: `TripDetails`.

### 8.4 PUT `/trips/:id`

- Auth: `requireAuthentication` + owner/moderator (else `403 FORBIDDEN`).
- Path params (strict): `{ id }`. Body (strict): `{ title, description, group, transport }`.
- Response `200`: `TripDetails`.

### 8.5 DELETE `/trips/:id`

- Auth: `requireAuthentication` + owner/moderator.
- Path params (strict): `{ id }`.
- Response `204` (empty).

### 8.6 POST `/trips/:tripId/days`

- Auth: `requireAuthentication` + owner/moderator.
- Path params (strict): `{ tripId }`. Body (strict): `{ dayNumber?, title?, description? }`.
- Response `201`: `TripDay`.
- `dayNumber` omitted -> assigned `max(dayNumber)+1`. Duplicate `dayNumber` -> `409 CONFLICT` ("Day N already exists in this trip.").

### 8.7 PUT `/trips/:tripId/days/reorder`

- Auth: `requireAuthentication` + owner/moderator.
- Path params (strict): `{ tripId }`. Body (strict): `{ dayIds: number[] }`.
- Response `200`: `TripDay[]` (re-ordered).
- `dayIds` must contain exactly all day ids of the trip; otherwise `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`.

### 8.8 PUT `/trips/:tripId/days/:dayId`

- Auth: `requireAuthentication` + owner/moderator.

  "description": null | "<string>",
  "latitude": null | 0.0,
  "longitude": null | 0.0,
  "images": [ SocialImageDto ],
  "social": SocialState
}
```

### 10.8 `TripDay` (day response DTO)

{ "id": 0, "url": "<url>", "thumbnailUrl": "<url>", "social": SocialState }
```

---

## 11. Image Endpoints

Mounted at `/api/v1/images`.

### 11.1 DELETE `/images/:imageId`

- Auth: `requireAuthentication` + owner/moderator (the image must be attached to a day of a trip group; a profile image or unattached image is `404 NOT_FOUND`).
- Path params (strict): `{ imageId }`.
- Response `204` (empty). The original object and its thumbnail sidecar are deleted from storage before the row is removed.

### 11.2 Image upload contract (all image uploads)

Applies to `POST /auth/me/image`, `POST /trips/:tripId/days/:dayId/images`, and `POST /points/:pointId/images`.

- Multipart field name: `file`.
- Exactly one binary part per request; no text fields are part of the contract (`files: 1`, `fields: 0`, `parts: 1`).
- Max file size: `25 MB` (`MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`).
- Accepted MIME (declared): `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`.
- Accepted extensions: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`.
- Decoded format (authoritative; bytes are inspected with Sharp): `jpeg`, `png`, `webp`, `gif`. HEIC/HEIF, SVG, TIFF, AVIF are not accepted.
- Decoded dimension ceilings: width/height <= `10000`, total pixels <= `50_000_000` (counting all frames).
- Processing: the backend re-encodes/sanitizes the image (EXIF orientation applied via `rotate()`; re-encoded per format). The frontend is expected only to stay within the 25 MB upload cap; the backend does its own sanitizing/re-encoding and thumbnail generation.
- Storage: server-generated object key `images/<uuid>.<ext>`; create-only writes (`ifGenerationMatch: 0`). The original is stored as-is (sanitized), and a thumbnail sidecar `<name>_thumb.webp` (800x600, `fit: inside`, quality 80, webp) is generated.
- Max images per entity: `9` per day row and `9` per point (a day image row has `Image.tripId` = day row id; a point image row has `Image.pointId`).
- Oversized/unsupported uploads are `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`; a generated-key collision is `409 CONFLICT`.

### 11.3 Image URL construction

`ImageDto.url` and `ImageDto.thumbnailUrl` are built from the stored `images.filePath` (`src/mappers/imageMapper.ts`):

- If `filePath` already starts with `http://` or `https://`, it is returned unchanged.
- Otherwise it is prefixed with `visual.image_base_url` (trailing slashes trimmed): `<image_base_url>/<filePath>`.
- The thumbnail URL uses the thumbnail sidecar name `<base>_thumb.webp` (see section 11.2).
- `image_base_url` is read from the runtime dynamic config (`visual` service, key `image_base_url`).

## 18. Zod Request Schemas

All schemas are `.strict()` unless noted. Numbers may be sent as numeric JSON values or as numeric strings where noted (query strings).

### 18.1 Shared helpers

- `trimmedString({max, min?, pattern?, patternMessage?})`: `z.string() -> trim() -> pipe(min/max/regex)`. Surrounding whitespace is removed before validation.
- `passwordString({min,max})`: `z.string().min(min).max(max).refine(byteLength <= max)`. Never trimmed.
- `optionalText({max,min?})`: `union(trimmedString, null).optional()` then transforms `undefined`/`null`/`''` -> `null`. Output `string | null`.
- `patchText({max,min?})`: same as optionalText but keeps `undefined` as `undefined` (partial update; blank clears to null).
- `requiredNumber({min,max})`: `union(number, string(min 1 char) -> Number)` then `pipe(number.min.max)`.
- `patchNumber({min,max})`: `union(number.min.max, string->Number.min.max, null).optional()`. Output `number | null | undefined`.
- `optionalInt({min,max})`: preprocess `''`/`null` -> `undefined`, then `coerce.number().int().min.max.optional()`.
- `positiveIdParam`: `z.string().regex(/^\d+$/)` and refine 1..2147483647.
- `userIdParam`: `z.string().regex(UUID)`.
- `positiveId`: `z.coerce.number().int().min(1).max(2147483647)`.
- `targetTypeInput`: `z.string().trim().toLowerCase().pipe(z.enum(['tripgroup','day','trip','point','image']))`.
- `idList({min,max})`: `z.array(positiveId).min(min).max(max).refine(no duplicate ids)`.

DATABASE MODELS (not returned by the API): `User`, `TripGroup`, `Trip`, `Point`, `Comment`, `Like`, `Favorite`, `Report`, `Image`, `TargetType`, `EmailVerificationToken`, `PasswordResetToken`, `RefreshToken`, `FailedLog`, `RouteNotFoundLog`, `SelectType`, `SelectOption`, `ServiceType`, `ServiceConfig`, `Verify`. The frontend must not rely on their column shapes.

## 20. Security Semantics

1. **Missing `x-hacktrip-client` header**: `404 NOT_FOUND` (with error body on `/api/v1*`, empty body otherwise). Not authenticated as anonymous.
2. **Invalid user access JWT**: `401 UNAUTHORIZED`. Never downgraded to anonymous.
3. **Missing `Authorization` at an authentication boundary** (including public reads): `404 NOT_FOUND`. Not anonymous.
4. **Expired user access JWT**: `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.
5. **Expired refresh token**: `401 UNAUTHORIZED` ("The refresh session has expired.").
6. **Refresh token reuse**: `401 UNAUTHORIZED`; all sessions of the account are revoked.
7. **Suspended account**: `403 ACCOUNT_SUSPENDED` (login/refresh and any authenticated request).
8. **Deactivated account**: `403 ACCOUNT_DEACTIVATED`.
9. **Unverified email**: `403 EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` (login/refresh and any authenticated request).
10. **Authenticated user requesting a resource they do not own** (trip/day/point/image mutation): `403 FORBIDDEN` ("Only the trip owner can modify this trip.").
11. **Manager accessing moderator functionality**: allowed — `manager` is in `MODERATOR_ROLES`.
12. **Admin accessing admin functionality**: allowed — `admin` is in both `ADMIN_ROLES` and `MODERATOR_ROLES`.
13. **Public GET with no Authorization**: `404 NOT_FOUND`.
14. **Public GET with a valid Authorization token**: authenticated viewer context; viewer-specific fields (`likedByMe`, `favoritedByMe`) are returned.
15. **Public GET with an invalid Authorization token**: `401 UNAUTHORIZED`; never silently turned anonymous.

The frontend must preserve these semantics and must never silently turn an invalid authenticated request into an anonymous request.

## 22. Frontend Integration Notes

This section contains frontend-specific integration guidance. It does not change any API behavior; the rest of this document remains the authoritative behavioral contract.

### 22.1 Base URL

The frontend resolves the deployed backend API base URL from its own deployment environment (e.g. an environment variable or build-time runtime configuration). This document does not fix a production value because the production origin is deployment-specific. All paths in this document are relative to that base URL under `/api/v1`.

### 22.2 Credentials (refresh cookie)

- The refresh token is delivered in an HttpOnly cookie (`hack_trip_refresh`, scoped to `/api/v1/auth`) and never in a response body.
- Requests that must carry the cookie — `POST /auth/refresh` and `POST /auth/logout` — must be sent with credentials enabled: `credentials: 'include'` (Fetch) or `withCredentials: true` (Axios).
- The frontend never reads or stores the refresh cookie value; it is managed by the browser.

### 22.3 Frontend Zod module map

The intended frontend validation organization mirrors the backend slices. The backend schemas (section 18) remain authoritative; the frontend must preserve `.strict()` behavior and exact field constraints.

```text
src/validations/
├── auth/
├── trips/
├── points/
├── comments/
├── social/
└── admin/
```

| Module | Backend schemas |
| --- | --- |
| `auth/` | `registerSchema`, `loginSchema`, `verifyEmailSchema`, `resendVerificationSchema`, `updateProfileSchema`, `confirmPasswordSchema`, `changePasswordSchema`, `forgotPasswordSchema`, `resetPasswordSchema` |
| `trips/` | `tripWriteSchema`, `tripListQuerySchema`, `dayCreateSchema`, `dayUpdateSchema`, `dayReorderSchema`, `pointReorderSchema` |
| `points/` | `pointCreateSchema`, `pointUpdateSchema` |
| `comments/` | `commentBodySchema`, `commentPageQuerySchema` |
| `social/` | `socialTargetBodySchema`, `socialTargetQuerySchema`, `favoriteBodySchema`, `favoriteQuerySchema`, `reportBodySchema` |
| `admin/` | `adminUserUpdateSchema`, `failedLogDeleteSchema`, `adminPaginationQuerySchema` |

Route-parameter schemas (section 18.7) are shared and used across modules: `userIdParams`, `tripIdParams`, `tripIdOnlyParams`, `tripDayParams`, `dayIdParams`, `pointIdParams`, `pointImageParams`, `imageIdParams`, `commentIdParams`, `tripGroupIdParams`.
